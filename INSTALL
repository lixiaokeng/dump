	Installation of the dump/restore port should be quite easy, since
a configure script is now provided.

	Configuration is made by running the configure script.  Run
`configure --help' to get a list of options.

	After configuring the package, you can type `make' to compile the
programs, and `make install' to install the binaries in /sbin and the
manual pages in `/usr/man/man8'.

	You need to have the latest Ext2fs programs installed on your system
since this version of dump uses the Ext2fs library written by Theodore T'so.
The Ext2fs programs distribution is available from tsx-11.mit.edu in the
directory /pub/linux/packages/ext2fs.
