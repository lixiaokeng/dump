	Installation of the dump/restore port should be quite easy, since
a configure script is now provided.

	Configuration is made by running the configure script.  Run
`configure --help' to get a list of options.

	After configuring the package, you can type `make' to compile the
programs, and `make install' to install the binaries in /usr/local/sbin and
the manual pages in `/usr/local/man/man8'.

	You need to have the latest Ext2fs programs installed on your system
since this version of dump uses the Ext2fs library written by Theodore T'so.
The Ext2fs programs are included in all Linux distributions (e2fsprogs and
e2fsprogs-dev[el] packages), or you can download the most up to date version
from http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net.
