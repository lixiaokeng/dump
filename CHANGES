Changes between versions 0.4b5 and 0.4b6
========================================

1.	Integrated multiple patches from RedHat, Debian and SuSE:

	- tweak dump/itime.c to not try to read dumpdates if the 'u' option 
	  isn't specified.
	- several fixes in the man pages.
	- update the default tape device to /dev/st0.
	- many updates for Linux Alpha (byte ordering, size_t etc).
	- buffer overruns.
	- use environment variable for TMPDIR (instead of /tmp).
	- use sigjmp_buf instead of jmp_buf (RedHat bug #3260).
	- workaround egcs bug (RedHat bugs #4281 and #2989).
	- wire $(OPT) throughout Makefile's.

2.	Fix some compile warnings, prototype all functions.

3.	Use glibc err/glob instead of internal compatibility
	routines (only if available).

Changes between versions 0.4b4 and 0.4b5
========================================

1.	Integrated the changes from FreeBSD-3.1-RELEASE
	(mostly bug fixes, buffer overruns, dump has now an "automatic
	tape length calculation" flag, dump/restore can use kerberos now
	(this is NOT tested), use environment variables for TAPE and
	RMT etc.).

2.	Integrated three RedHat patches ("glibc", "kernel" and "bread" patches)

3.	Corrected a bug in restore when using 'C' option with multi-volumes
	tapes (files splited accros two tapes give "size changed" errors
	when comparing).

4.	Corrected the long standing bug when dumping multiple tapes.
	This works for me, needs further testing.

Changes between versions 0.4b3 and 0.4b4
========================================

1.	Dump now runs correctly on kernels 2.1.x
	Fix made by Gerald Peters <gapeters@worldnet.att.net>

Changes between versions 0.4b2 and 0.4b3
========================================

1.	Use realpath() if available

2.	Report statistics

Changes between versions 0.4b1 and 0.4b2
========================================

1.	Fixed the bug fix from Greg Lutz (I had made a mistake when integrating
	the patch)

2.	Fixed restore to make it able to read FreeBSD 2.x dumps again

3.	Fixed configure.in to correctly handle --enable-rmt

Changes between versions 0.3 and 0.4b1
======================================

1.	Integrated the changes from 4.4BSD-Lite2

2.	Integrated the patches from Debian and Red Hat

3.	Portability changes: use the __u32, __u16, __s32, and __s16 types

4.	Changed dump to use the Ext2fs library to get block addresses.  This
	should solve the endianness problem on SparcLinux.

5.	Created a configure.in file (shamelessly stolen from the e2fsprogs
	distribution's one) to use autoconf

6.	Fixed a few minor bugs

Changes between versions 0.2e and 0.2f
======================================

1.	Added the creation of named pipes (fifos) in restore.

2.	Added the -N flag in the restore manual page.

3.	Added the file kernel.patch which contains the llseek() optimization
	patch for 1.2.x kernels.

4.	Fixed a bug in the restoration of symbolic links: owner and group were
	not restored.

5.	Integrated some changes from FreeBSD 2.2.

6.	Added a call to ftruncate() after restoring each file to restore
	correctly files ending by a hole.

Changes between versions 0.2d and 0.2e
======================================

1.	Fixed a bug in the "set owner/mode" process.  Every file was restored
	with owner = root (0) and group = root/wheel/whatever (0).

Changes between versions 0.2c and 0.2d
======================================

1.	Dump is now able to backup 2GB+ filesystems.

2.	Dump and restore can now be linked as static binaries.

Changes between versions 0.2b and 0.2c
======================================

1.	Fixed a bug when dumping ``slow'' (i.e. normal) symbolic links.

Changes between versions 0.2a and 0.2b
======================================

1.	Really fixed the bug that I should have corrected in 0.2a.

2.	Enabled optimization again.

Changes between versions 0.2 and 0.2a
=====================================

1.	Disabled the optimization during compilation.

Changes between versions 0.1 and 0.2
====================================

1.	Fixed a bug in fstab.c which caused a null pointer to be stored in
	the fs_type field (actually, I modified the file fstab.c to make it
	use the mntent functions).

2.	Dump and restore now use a 4.3 BSD compatible dump format.  Backups
	made by dump should be readable by the BSD restore and backups made
	by the BSD dump should be readable by restore.  Unfortunately, this
	means that the dump format has changed between version 0.1 and version
	0.2 :-(

3.	Dump is now able to backup a subtree, it is no longer limited to whole
	filesystems like the BSD version.

4.	Dump now uses ext2_llseek() so it is able to backup filesystems bigger
	than 2 GB.

Changes between versions 0.0 and 0.1
====================================

1.	Now create links rdump and rrestore during the `make install' step.

2.	Linux port specific bugs added to the manual pages

3.	Incorrect estimation of the number of tapes blocks fixed when doing
	incremental backups.

4.	Better ls-like format in restore in interactive mode.
