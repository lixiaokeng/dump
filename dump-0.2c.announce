	Yet another bug fix release of dump/restore for Ext2fs is available
on tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/packages/ext2fs/dump-0.2c.tar.gz.

	A stupid bug has been fixed.  This bug caused an incorrect dump of
``slow'' (i.e. normal) symbolic links.  There is no new features (yet :-).

	Thanks to the many people who have sent me success and bug reports!
