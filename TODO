Need to verify:
---------------

1.	Verify that dump works with kerberos authentification (this
	was ported from *BSD and was not tested - in fact, this
	wasn't even compiled in!). Need success reports for this.

Urgent items (for the next stable version):
-------------------------------------------

All others:
-----------

1.	Make dump able to backup several directories and/or files in one
	invocation, like the SunOS version.

2.	More documentation? Examples, crontab?

3.	Explore and correct dump problems on active filesystems 
	(lseek/read negative count).

4.	Reimplement the ext2 specific code in a "backend" and
	make the dump code more generic. This would allow creation
	of other backends for other filesystems. Implementing a 
	(v)fat backend should be quite easy, as for BSD ffs (we
	already have the code for this). The BSD code in traverse.c
	(all those #ifdef _BSD) should go into the ffs backend.

5.	Implement a DEBUG option which doesn't fork on each tape, making
	it able to debug dump with gdb.
