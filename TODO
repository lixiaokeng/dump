1.	Make dump honor the no-dump attribute on directories.  Currently, it
	honours it only on files.  This means that a directory flagged with
	the no-dump attribute will be dumped if it contains a file without
	the no-dump flag.

2.	Make dump able to backup several directories and/or files in one
	invocation, like the SunOS version.
