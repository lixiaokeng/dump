Need to verify:
---------------

1.	Verify that dump works with kerberos authentification (this
	was ported from *BSD and was not tested - in fact, this
	wasn't even compiled in!). Need success reports for this.

Urgent items (for the next stable version):
-------------------------------------------

All others:
-----------

1.	More documentation? Examples, crontab?

2.	Explore and correct dump problems on active filesystems 
	(lseek/read negative count) (This should be OK as of 0.4b14.
	Unfortunately, this seems to continue for a very few users).

3.	Reimplement the ext2 specific code in a "backend" and
	make the dump code more generic. This would allow creation
	of other backends for other filesystems. Implementing a 
	(v)fat backend should be quite easy, as for BSD ffs (we
	already have the code for this). The BSD code in traverse.c
	(all those #ifdef _BSD) should go into the ffs backend.

4.	Implement a DEBUG option which doesn't fork on each tape, making
	it able to debug dump with gdb.

5.	Extend the compression patch to use bzip2.

6.	Make a bootable dump tape? I don't know if it is possible...

7.	From Kjetil Torgrim Homme <kjetilho@ifi.uio.no>:
	  a archive_file
	     Archive file. Archive a dump table-of-contents  in
	     the   specified   archive_file   to   be  used  by
	     ufsrestore(1M) to determine whether a file  is  in
	     the dump file that is being restored.

8.	Modify (or get rid of) rmt in order to work with non Linux
	systems (limited succes has been reported). A good version 
	of rmt to be looked at is part of star 
	http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/star.html

9.	EA/ACL support in dump (requested by Michael Ju. Tokarev 
	<mjt@tls.msk.ru>.

10.	Better readline completition in restore (escape spaces etc).

11.	Dump compiled with RedHat's 7.0 gcc seems to hang for some
	people. When compiled with kgcc all the problems disappear.
	Will the RedHat's 7.1 gcc resolve this ?

12.	Dump uses /dev/tty for reporting some messages. When invoked
	from a script, /dev/tty may not exist. Why not using just
	stderr ?

13.	-a and -B option to dump are exclusive.
