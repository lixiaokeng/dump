Need to verify:
---------------

1.	Verify that dump works correctly on rev 1 ext2fses (need success
	reports)

2.	Verify that dump works with kerberos authentification (this
	was ported from *BSD and was not tested - in fact, this
	wasn't even compiled in!). Need success reports for this.

Urgent items (for the next stable version):
-------------------------------------------

1.	Make dump honor the no-dump attribute on directories.  Currently, it
	honours it only on files.  This means that a directory flagged with
	the no-dump attribute will be dumped if it contains a file without
	the no-dump flag.

All others:
-----------

1.	Make dump able to backup several directories and/or files in one
	invocation, like the SunOS version.

2.	More documentation? Examples, crontab?

3.	Explore and correct dump problems on a 4GB+ active 
	filesystem (lseek/read negative count).

4.	Clean-up the code by removing all those #ifdef _BSD, 
	since nobody would ever re-compile this on a BSD system. 
	Since the tape format is the same, the native BSD
	restore can be used to restore tapes...

5.	Reimplement the ext2 specific code in a "backend" and
	make the dump code more generic. This would allow creation
	of other backends for other filesystems. Implementing a 
	(v)fat backend should be quite easy, as for BSD ffs (we
	already have the code for this).

6.	Implement a DEBUG option which doesn't fork on each tape, making
	it able to debug dump with gdb.
