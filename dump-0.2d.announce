	Ok, I am still trying to saturate comp.os.linux.announce :-)  Yet
another bug fix release of dump/restore for Ext2fs is available on
tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/packages/ext2fs/dump-0.2d.tar.gz.

	Dump is now able to backup 2GB+ filesystems.  Thanks to Doug Paul
<dbp@dragonsys.com> for the patch.  Dump and restore can now be linked as
static binaries (you have to edit the file MCONFIG before building them).
