The dump and restore backup suit was ported to Linux's Second
Extended File System by Rémy Card <card@Linux.EU.Org>

He was the maintainer of the initial versions of dump (up and
including 0.4b4, released in january 1997).

I decided to continue the developpement and release a new version.
Rémy didn't respond to any mail I sent to him, so I have
promoted myself as the new maintainer :)

So, starting with 0.4b5, the new maintainer is me,
Stelian Pop <pop@noos.fr>.
