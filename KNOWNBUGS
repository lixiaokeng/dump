Known bugs and limitations of the dump/restore port
===================================================

1.	I have tried to minimize changes in the BSD source and some parts
	may look ugly.  dump/tape.c is really awfull but this is pure BSD
	code :-)  Maybe, I should replace it with a simpler and cleaner
	version.

2.	Kerberos mode is _NOT_ tested.

3.	Some users related possible problems when dumping large,
	active (mounted) filesystems. The problems are reported as
	lseek and read error messages (with a negative count). If
	you encounter this kind of problems, please report them
	to the author.
