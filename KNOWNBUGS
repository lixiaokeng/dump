Known bugs and limitations of the dump/restore port
===================================================

1.	Multi-volume does not work: restore does not succeeds in
	resynchronizing itself on a multi-volume dump.  Thus, some files are
	not restored.

	Update: this is fixed in 4.0b5, needs succes reports!

2.	I have tried to minimize changes in the BSD source and some parts
	may look ugly.  dump/tape.c is really awfull but this is pure BSD
	code :-)  Maybe, I should replace it with a simpler and cleaner
	version.

3.	Kerberos mode is _NOT_ tested.
